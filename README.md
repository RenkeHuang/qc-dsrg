# qc-dsrg

1. Intergals and mapping: 
- 'forte_get_1q_coeffs.py' can use Forte 'master' branch to compute one-qubit mapping coefficients using as_ints object, avoiding 'qc' branch and "external" active_space_solver to get integrals.

2. Experiments on ibmq backend
- qc_ci_solver.py
- qiskit is installed in "psi4-2021" conda enviroment.

3. SA-MR-LDSRG(2) downfolding
- 'qc' branch, "external" active_space_solver
